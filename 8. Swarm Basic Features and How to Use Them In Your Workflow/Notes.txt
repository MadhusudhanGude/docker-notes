1. Scaling Out with Overlay Networking
#######
Create 3 Node swarm cluster and then execute the below commands in node 1
#########

>> ... --driver overlay
    New networking driver, which enables swarm wide bridge network
    Contaniers across hosts which are on the same network connnect through vlan
    Intra swarm network
    Each service can be connected to multiple networks


>> docker network create --driver overlay my_network
    creating overlay network

>> docker service create --name psql --network my_network -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pass postgres
>> docker service ls
>> docker service ps psql
    Observe this service started on node1

>> docker service create --name drupal --network my_network -p 80:80 drupal
Start a new service

>> docker service ps drupal
    Observe this service started on node2

ID                  NAME                IMAGE               NODE                DESIRED STATE       CURRENT STATE            ERROR               PORTS

>>
These twos services, though they are on two different nodes, 
they can talk to each other using the same overlay network
Overlay network works as subnet

>> docker service inspect drupal 
Although it actually runs on single node, it cn stillbe accessible form any of the three nodes
Because of Routing mesh

##########
Scaling Routing Mesh

>> Routing Mesh
    It will load balances swarm services across all the nodes and listening all the node for traffic

>> It is enabled by default


##########
Stacks
    Compose files for production swarm
    It combines services, volumes and overlay networks

>> docker stack deploy -c <compose_file> <stack_name>
    It import compose file and run the commands that we put in it

>> docker stack ls
>> docker stack ps <stack_name>
>> docker stack services <stack_name>
>> docker network ls

##########
Secrets
    Secure way for storing secrets in swarm
    Secrets like username, password, ssh key, API keys, certificates

>> docker secret create <secret_name> <secret_file_name>
    Reading secrets from file

>> echo "mypassword" | docker secret create <secret_name> -
    Reading secrets from standard input

>> docker secret ls


>> docker service create --name msql --secret ....................
